      <p> I love you more than words can ever express. 💖</p>
      <p>
        You are not just my sister — you are my safe place,
         my strength, and my closest friend. 
         No matter how difficult life gets, 
         knowing you are beside me gives me courage. 
         You understand my silence, support my dreams,
          and stand with me even when the world feels against me.

        From the very beginning of my life,
         you have been a part of my happiest memories.
          You are the one who stood beside me in my childhood, 
          shared my laughter, wiped my tears, and made every moment brighter just by being there.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="back">
      <p>
        When life feels heavy and the world seems unfair, your words bring peace to my heart. 
        You have this beautiful way of understanding me without me saying anything.
